# Lord-of-the-Strings
This is my first game project using HTML Canvas, JavaScript.

==============
Key Concept
==============
Lord of the Strings is a dynamic tennis simulation game that allows the ball to bounce from the wall but loses a point when the ball passes the player. The user can select a player then be able to move either up or down to hit the ball and try to win aginst the computer. The point system will go by the tennis rules within six points game (please see below infrastructure to look into details about the tennis point system rules).
